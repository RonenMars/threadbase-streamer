/**
 * Noise_IKpsk1_25519_ChaChaPoly_SHA256 (#590, Phase 2).
 *
 * A test that asserts "it encrypted something" passes on a broken
 * implementation, so none of these do that. What is asserted is the three
 * properties the handshake exists for:
 *
 *   1. A handshake against a static key OTHER than the QR's fails — this is
 *      server authentication, and it is the whole reason `spk` is in the QR.
 *   2. A wrong or absent PSK fails — the pair token genuinely binds the
 *      handshake to *this* QR rather than being mixed in and ignored.
 *   3. A tampered ciphertext is rejected, anywhere in the message.
 *
 * Plus the interop contract: fixed keys produce exactly the committed bytes, so
 * tb-mobile's independent implementation can be checked against the same file.
 *
 * WHEN ADDING A NEGATIVE TEST HERE, the obvious shape is the broken one.
 * An assertion placed inside exception-handling control flow cannot distinguish
 * "failed correctly" from "never ran" — the catch block executes only on
 * failure, so it is silent about the case where nothing failed at all. The
 * "fails before the initiator's payload is ever decrypted" test below was
 * written that way first and would have passed against an implementation with
 * no server authentication whatsoever. Every negative test here therefore pairs
 * with a positive control that proves the observation fires when it should.

 * are `HKDF(ck, "")`, so rendering it hands over the whole session rather than a
 * fragment. It printed at `util.inspect`'s DEFAULT depth, no `showHidden`
 * needed, because these four objects were the ones §13's "every object holding
 * key material installs a handler" had not reached.
 *
 * The assertion is needle-free on purpose: it checks that NO buffer renders at
