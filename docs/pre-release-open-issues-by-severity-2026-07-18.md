# Open Pre-release Issues by Severity — status update

## Release verdict (updated)

> **Improved.** The former P0 (stale conversation history) and several P1 install/setup issues are in open PRs. Remaining open work is mostly ops polish, Windows scope, and enhancements — not first-session product blockers for a macOS-first OSS invite.

## Resolved / in flight (since 2026-07-18)

| Issue | Status | PR |

| Homebrew vs deploy.sh plist conflict check | In flight — warn on serve + doctor | [#238](https://github.com/RonenMars/threadbase-streamer/pull/238) |
| `bootstrapAgent` exit-5 false-positive | In flight — requires `afterBootout` | [#240](https://github.com/RonenMars/threadbase-streamer/pull/240) |
| Upload filenames with spaces break `@path` refs | In flight — sanitizeFilename | [#241](https://github.com/RonenMars/threadbase-streamer/pull/241) |
| Quick Access historical conversation routing | Superseded on modern mobile (Favorites + conversation type); legacy `/api/sessions/recents` retained for older clients | — |
